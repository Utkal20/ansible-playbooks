## Overview

This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the use of AWX to manage and configure network devices using Ansible playbooks. AWX provides a web-based user interface for Ansible, offering features such as job scheduling, real-time job output, and integration with source control.

## Key Capabilities of AWX

1. **Web-based Interface**: AWX offers a user-friendly web interface to manage and execute Ansible playbooks.
2. **Job Scheduling**: Users can schedule playbooks to run at specific times.
3. **Real-time Output**: AWX provides real-time output of playbook execution, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot.
4. **Source Control Integration**: It integrates with version control systems like Git, allowing users to pull playbooks directly from repositories.
5. **User Management**: AWX includes role-based access control, allowing administrators to define what different users can do.

## Role of Ansible Playbooks

Ansible playbooks are central to the functioning of AWX. These playbooks contain the logic and instructions for performing automation tasks, including network device configuration. AWX does not directly configure devices; instead, it executes the playbooks that do.

## How AWX Configures Network Devices

1. **Define Playbooks**: Create Ansible playbooks that include tasks for configuring network devices.
2. **Execute Playbooks**: Use AWX to schedule and run these playbooks.
3. **Automation and Orchestration**: AWX orchestrates the execution of playbooks but relies on the playbooks to perform the actual configuration.

### Example Workflow

1. **Create Playbooks**: Develop playbooks to configure network devices. For example:
    ```yaml
    - name: Configure network devices
      hosts: all
      tasks:
        - name: Configure hostname
          command: hostnamectl set-hostname "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        - name: Configure IP address
          command: ip addr add {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}/24 dev eth0
        - name: Bring up network interface
          command: ip link set eth0 up
        - name: Update /etc/hosts
          lineinfile:
            path: /etc/hosts
            line: "{{ item }}"
          with_items:
            - "192.168.1.1 ansible1"
            - "192.168.1.2 ansible2"
    ```
2. **Add to AWX**: Add these playbooks to AWX by creating a project and linking it to a source control repository.
3. **Create Inventory**: Define an inventory in AWX with the devices to be configured.
4. **Run Jobs**: Use AWX to run the playbooks against the inventory.

## Addressing Expectations

If the expectation is to configure network devices directly through a UI without using playbooks, it's important to clarify that AWX does not support this mode of operation. Instead, AWX relies on playbooks for all configurations.

### Alternatives and Enhancements

1. **Custom UI**: Develop a custom web interface that translates user inputs into Ansible playbook commands and uses AWXâ€™s API to execute them. This approach provides a more user-friendly way to manage configurations without directly editing playbooks.
2. **Direct Automation Tools**: Explore other automation tools that might offer more direct device management capabilities if immediate UI-based configuration is required.

## Detailed Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running.
- **Kubernetes**: Ensure Kubernetes is installed and running (e.g., using Minikube or k3s).
- **AWX**: Deployed on your Kubernetes cluster.

### Deploying K3s and AWX Operator

1. **Deploy K3s**

    Install K3s:
    ```bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
    ```

    Validate the installation:
    ```bash
    kubectl version
    ```

    If logged in with a non-root account (e.g., `adminusr`), change the ownership of the k3s configuration file:
    ```bash
    sudo chown adminusr:adminusr /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
    ```

    List the nodes:
    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

2. **Deploy Kustomize and AWX Operator**

    Create the `kustomization.yml` file in your home directory:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    resources:
      - github.com/ansible/awx-operator/config/default?ref=2.5.3
    images:
      - name: quay.io/ansible/awx-operator
        newTag: 2.5.3
    namespace: awx
    ```

    Initiate the build process:
    ```bash
    kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
    ```

    Validate the deployment of the required pods:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n awx
    ```

3. **Create `awx-demo.yml` and Expose Application**

    Create the `awx-demo.yml` file:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: awx.ansible.com/v1beta1
    kind: AWX
    metadata:
      name: awx-demo
    spec:
      service_type: nodeport
    ```

    Modify the `kustomization.yml`:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    resources:
      - github.com/ansible/awx-operator/config/default?ref=2.5.3
      - awx-demo.yml
    images:
      - name: quay.io/ansible/awx-operator
        newTag: 2.5.3
    namespace: awx
    ```

    Run the deployment again:
    ```bash
    kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
    ```

4. **Access AWX Application**

    Find the port number to access the application:
    ```bash
    kubectl get svc -n awx
    ```

    Fetch the secret password for the admin user:
    ```bash
    kubectl get secret awx-demo-admin-password -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" -n awx | base64 --decode | more
    ```

    Access AWX from the browser using the VM IP and port number:
    ```
    https://<vm-ip>:<port-number>
    ```

    Login with username `admin` and the password retrieved from the previous step.

### Setting Up Docker Containers for Network Configuration

1. **Build the Custom Docker Image**

    Create a Dockerfile with the following content:
    ```Dockerfile
    # Use the official Python image
    FROM python:3.10-slim

    # Install necessary packages
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        openssh-server \
        iproute2 \
        sshpass \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

    # Install Ansible and six
    RUN pip install ansible six

    # Configure SSH
    RUN mkdir /var/run/sshd && \
        echo 'root:password' | chpasswd && \
        sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && \
        sed -i 's/#PasswordAuthentication.*/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && \
        echo 'PermitRootLogin yes' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config && \
        echo 'PasswordAuthentication yes' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    # Create SSH directory and generate keys
    RUN mkdir -p /root/.ssh && \
        ssh-keygen -A

    # Expose SSH port
    EXPOSE 22

    # Start SSH service
    CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"]
    ```

    Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t ansible-network-config .
    ```

2. **Create a Docker Network**
    ```bash
    docker network create my-net
    ```

3. **Run Docker Containers**
    ```bash
    docker run -d --name ansible1 --network my-net --privileged -p 2224:22 ansible-network-config

        - name: Bring up network interface
          command: ip link set eth0 up
        - name: Update /etc/hosts
          lineinfile:
            path: /etc/hosts
            line: "{{ item }}"
          with_items:
            - "192.168.1.1 ansible1"
