AWX Proof of Concept (POC) for Network Device Configuration
Overview
This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the use of AWX to manage and configure network devices using Ansible playbooks. AWX provides a web-based user interface for Ansible, offering features such as job scheduling, real-time job output, and integration with source control.

Key Capabilities of AWX
Web-based Interface: AWX offers a user-friendly web interface to manage and execute Ansible playbooks.
Job Scheduling: Users can schedule playbooks to run at specific times.
Real-time Output: AWX provides real-time output of playbook execution, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot.
Source Control Integration: It integrates with version control systems like Git, allowing users to pull playbooks directly from repositories.
User Management: AWX includes role-based access control, allowing administrators to define what different users can do.
Role of Ansible Playbooks
Ansible playbooks are central to the functioning of AWX. These playbooks contain the logic and instructions for performing automation tasks, including network device configuration. AWX does not directly configure devices; instead, it executes the playbooks that do.

How AWX Configures Network Devices
Define Playbooks: Create Ansible playbooks that include tasks for configuring network devices.
Execute Playbooks: Use AWX to schedule and run these playbooks.
Automation and Orchestration: AWX orchestrates the execution of playbooks but relies on the playbooks to perform the actual configuration.
Example Workflow
Create Playbooks: Develop playbooks to configure network devices. For example:
yaml
Copy code
- name: Configure network devices
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Configure hostname
      command: hostnamectl set-hostname "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    - name: Configure IP address
      command: ip addr add {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}/24 dev eth0
    - name: Bring up network interface
      command: ip link set eth0 up
    - name: Update /etc/hosts
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/hosts
        line: "{{ item }}"
      with_items:
        - "192.168.1.1 ansible1"
        - "192.168.1.2 ansible2"
Add to AWX: Add these playbooks to AWX by creating a project and linking it to a source control repository.
Create Inventory: Define an inventory in AWX with the devices to be configured.
Run Jobs: Use AWX to run the playbooks against the inventory.
Addressing Expectations
If the expectation is to configure network devices directly through a UI without using playbooks, it's important to clarify that AWX does not support this mode of operation. Instead, AWX relies on playbooks for all configurations.

Alternatives and Enhancements
Custom UI: Develop a custom web interface that translates user inputs into Ansible playbook commands and uses AWXâ€™s API to execute them. This approach provides a more user-friendly way to manage configurations without directly editing playbooks.
Direct Automation Tools: Explore other automation tools that might offer more direct device management capabilities if immediate UI-based configuration is required.
Conclusion
AWX is a powerful tool for automating IT tasks and managing network device configurations through Ansible playbooks. It provides extensive capabilities for scheduling, monitoring, and controlling the execution of these playbooks. However, it does not directly configure devices through its UI. The actual configuration logic resides in the playbooks, which are executed by AWX. For direct UI-based configuration, additional development or alternative tools may be required.
